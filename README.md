The Docker Project, revolutionized the tech landscape in 2013 by introducing the concept of "containers," portable sandboxes for running programs. This innovation played a significant role in driving the widespread adoption of cloud technology.

This hands-on project is geared toward helping users run containerized applications using Docker on an Ubuntu system. The project unfolds in the following stages:

1. [Installation Docker Engine on Ubuntu](1-installing-docker-engine-on-ubuntu.md): It begins with the installation of Docker Engine on Ubuntu, guiding users through the installation process, version verification, and configuration for automatic startup.
2. [Exploring Docker Client](2-the-docker-client.md): Next, the project delves into the Docker client and its pivotal role in managing Docker containers. It explores various Docker commands like 'docker run,' 'docker stop,' 'docker ps,' and 'docker logs.'
3. [Lab: Hosting Web Servers in Docker Containers](3-lab-running-webservers-in-a-docker-container.md): This project segment demonstrates how to run web servers within a Docker container. It details the creation of a Dockerfile, image building, and container execution. It also explores the use of different web server images, such as Apache and Nginx.
4. [Accessing Container Shells](4-getting-shell-access-to-a-container.md): The project explains how to access the shell of a running container, employing Docker commands like 'docker exec' and 'docker attach' for this purpose.
5. [Modifying Containers](5-modifying-a-container.md): The project concludes by explaining how to modify a running container. It outlines the steps to create a new image from a running container, make modifications to the image, and create a new container using the modified image.

This practical project offers a comprehensive education on running containerized applications using Docker on an Ubuntu system. It encompasses Docker Engine installation, Docker client usage, web server deployment within containers, container shell access, and container modification.
